Using the Themes in Vencord, I can use the Persona 3 Font for the text, which to me is much more apealing.

Anyways, install Vencord.

Download and install "BMSPA__.TTF"
Put "pfont.theme.css" in vencords themes folder and enable.

There, done. Something niche that I did months ago and only now got around to updating and uploading to here.
